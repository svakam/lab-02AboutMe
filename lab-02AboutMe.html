    <h1>All About Cindy Weiss</h1>
    <P> Hello, my name is Cindy and I am so happy to be learning code! <br>
        I have no background in computer programing at all so this is all very new to me. Some of the jobs that I do
        have experience in are;
        <ul>
            <li>Retail Management</li>
            <li>Chef/Line Cook positions</li>
            <li>Restaurant management</li>
            <li>Accounting</li>
        </ul>


        I started my career managing various retail chains over the years. My last employer I started with the company
        back in
        2005 as a Line cook and continued to work for them while I went to the University of Washington pursuing my
        bachelar's degree in business administration. I stayed on at the U of W for a second concentration in accounting
        and finished with enough credits that I am now eligable to sit for the CPA exam. Once I graduated I ended up
        staying on with the company but was promoted to my final role as their
        Accounting Operations Manager at their Bellevue location. It was right around this same time that I met my
        husband. We have been happily married now for 14 years and have four young children. We also have two pets in my
        family. A Dog named "bubba" and a parrot named "killer".

        <h2> My goals</h2>

        <p> Soon after being laid this past June I realized I needed to look at my current situation as this is a glass
            half full type of senerio. So
            trying to keep a positive outlook I decided this was as good as a time as any to re-evauate my career. I
            decided I didn't really love what I was doing so I was going to make some changes so that I could pursue
            somethig that I would love.</P>

        <p>My goals by attending Code Fellows is to fast track myself into a new career as a front end JavaScript web
            developer. I like the idea of creating something that others will get to see and interact with daily.</p>
