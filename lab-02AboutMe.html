    <h1>All About Cindy</h1>
    <P> Hello, my name is Cindy Weiss and I am so happy to be here! <br>
        Unfortunatly, I have no background in computer programing at all so this is all very new to me. I started my
        career as a chef for Maggiano's
        Little Italy back in 2005 and continued to work for them while I went to the University of Washington
        pursuing my Bachelar's degree. Once I graduated I stayed on with the company but changed my role to Accounting
        Operations Manager at their Bellevue location. It was right around this time that I met my now husband. We have
        now been married for 14 years and have four children. We also have two pets in my family. One Dog named "bubba"
        and a parrot named "killer".

        <h2> My goals</h2>

        <p> Recently I was laid off from my employer after spending almost a decade and a half with them. After getting
            over the initional
            shock I realized I needed to look at this as a glass is half full type of senerio. So trying to keep a
            positive outlook I decided this was as good as a time as any to re-evauate my career. </P>

        <p>My goals by attending Code Fellows is to fast track myself into a new career as a
            front end Javascript web
            developer. I like the idea of creating something that other will get to see and interact with daily.</p>
